5 April 2014: James McKaskill, the author of go-capnproto (https://github.com/jmckaskill/go-capnproto), 
has been super busy of late, so I agreed to take over as maintainer. This branch 
(https://github.com/glycerine/go-capnproto) includes my recent work to fix bugs in the
creation (originating) of structs for Go, and an implementation of the packing/unpacking capnp specification.
Thanks to Albert Strasheim (https://github.com/alberts/go-capnproto) of CloudFlare for a great set of packing tests. - Jason
